# Belt Conveyor design

The idea is to automate and optimize decisions in the process of belt conveyor
design. Focused on equipment for mining and heavy industries.

## Goals

Web-based system that uses a few inputs from the user and automatically select components,
calculate tensions, and iterate to find the best design.

Later, the system should be able to optimize the design, based on a given objective
(energy consumption, installation cost, long-term cost, etc...)

## Method

Initially, the design and calculation methods will be based on CEMA book *Belt conveyor
for bulk materials*  and Brazilian technical rules.
